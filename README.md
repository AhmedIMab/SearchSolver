Welcome to SearchSolver, a java developed application that can tell you exactly where the words you are looking for in a wordsearch are. 
Simply create a new text file with your grid and make sure the final line in the text file contains the words to search for, separated by a comma.
For clarification, there are some example grids to understand how to format your file.

To start the program, run the "SolverDriver.java" file in the sources (src) folder
