Using a Multi-dimensional (2D) array for grid
--> The size of the grid won't be changing
--> The time of a get operation is constant

First test, making the wordsearch grid from a file
---> checks the width
---> checks the height

Second test, populating the grid
--> Changes the grid to a array of strings (representing the rows)
--> Checks the rows against the expected rows

Third test, checking the possible words with a character at a position
--> The method uses an arraylist because it will not know how many elements will be in the list
